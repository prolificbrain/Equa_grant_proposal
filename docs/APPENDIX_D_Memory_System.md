```

**Layer Functions:**
1. **Core Memories** (Innermost): Essential relationship moments, promises, agreements
2. **Emotional Patterns**: Recurring feelings, emotional responses, triggers
3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Action sequences, communication styles, conflict patterns
4. **Contextual Awareness** (Outermost): Environmental factors, relationship timeline, external influences

## 🔐 **Security & Privacy Architecture**

### **On-Device Processing**
- **Zero Cloud Storage**: Memory graphs never leave user devices
- **Local-First Architecture**: Operates fully offline with optional sync
- **Device Encryption**: Leverages device-level security (Apple Secure Enclave, Android Strongbox)

### **Proprietary Encryption Protocol**
- **Memory Encoding**: Neural representations not human-readable text
- **Graph-Specific Encryption**: Custom encryption designed for graph structures
- **Key Management**: Multi-factor biometric-anchored key generation
- **Sharded Protection**: Memory fragments distributed across security layers

### **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**
- **Selective Sharing**: Share insights without revealing underlying memories
- **Verifiable Computation**: Prove memory-based calculations without exposing data
- **Cryptographic Commitments**: Secure partner agreements without centralized storage

## 🧩 **Technical Implementation**

### **Graph DNN Architecture**
- **Node Types**: Memories, Emotions, Actions, Contexts, Insights
- **Edge Types**: Causal, Temporal, Emotional, Contextual
- **Embedding Dimensions**: 256 for emotional vectors, 128 for contextual
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Multi-headed attention for cross-layer information flow

### **Memory Formation Process**
```
Raw Experience → Feature Extraction → Pattern Matching → 
Graph Integration → Cross-Referencing → Insight Generation
```

### **Retrieval Mechanisms**
- **Associative Recall**: Similarity-based memory activation
- **Temporal Chains**: Time-sequence memory reconstruction
- **Emotional Indexing**: Feeling-triggered memory access
- **Contextual Cues**: Environment-based memory activation

## 💡 **User Experience Benefits**

### **Intelligent Recall**
- **Conflict Pattern Detection**: "This reminds me of what happened last month..."
- **Agreement Tracking**: "You previously agreed to work on listening more..."
- **Progress Awareness**: "You've reduced interruptions by 40% since we started..."

### **Emotional Intelligence**
- **Trigger Warnings**: "This topic has been difficult for you both before..."
- **Emotional Forecasting**: "Based on past patterns, this approach may lead to frustration..."
- **Sentiment Analysis**: "Your emotional response has been more positive lately..."

### **Privacy Controls**
- **Memory Management**: Review, archive, or delete specific memories
- **Sharing Controls**: Choose which memories can be referenced in sessions
- **AI Boundaries**: Set limits on which memory layers AI can access
- **Partner Permissions**: Designate shared vs. private memories

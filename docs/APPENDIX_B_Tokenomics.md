# EQUA Token Tokenomics Design
*Building a Sustainable Social Impact Economy for Relationship Healing*

---

## üéØ **Vision & Core Philosophy**

The EQUA token represents a revolutionary approach to **social entrepreneurship tokenomics** - where the primary beneficiaries are the users themselves, not just the founders. This model creates a self-sustaining ecosystem where:

- **Users are the primary stakeholders** in the token economy
- **Founders take modest, sustainable rewards** aligned with social impact
- **Revenue flows back to the community** through rewards and experiences
- **Relationship healing becomes financially incentivized** at scale

## üí∞ **Token Economics Overview**

### **Total Supply & Distribution**
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 EQUA (1 Billion tokens)
- **Fixed Supply**: No inflation - promotes scarcity and value appreciation
- **Distribution Timeline**: 5 years with carefully planned release schedule

### **Token Allocation Breakdown**

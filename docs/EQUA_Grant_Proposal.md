## 1  Executive Summary
EQuA v2 is an **AI-powered relationship mediation mini-app** that turns conflict into collaboration for couples and friends. Blending six evidence-based therapeutic pillars with GPT-4.1, proprietary on-device memory system, World ID human verification, and a community-first token economy, EQuA delivers a guided, gamified journey from contested stories to co-created truth‚Äîall in under ten minutes.

Since January 2025 we have shipped a fully functional prototype: couples sign a digital pact, share verifiable truths, receive AI insights through our secure graph-based memory system, and earn EQUA tokens that unlock real-world experiences. With professional UX/UI and zero-knowledge privacy architecture, we are ready to scale from pilot users to **10 000 couples in 90 days**.

## 2  Problem Statement
‚Ä¢ **50 % of first marriages** end in divorce; therapy is expensive (\$150+/hour) and stigmatized.
‚Ä¢ Average couples wait **6 years** after problems emerge before seeking help (Gottman Institute).
‚Ä¢ Conflict costs US companies **\$359 B annually** in lost productivity (CPP Global).

Current solutions‚Äîtraditional therapy, generic chatbots, self-help apps‚Äîlack real-time mediation, evidence-based structure, or tangible incentives. Couples need an accessible, engaging, and data-driven path to repair trust **before** relationships break.
